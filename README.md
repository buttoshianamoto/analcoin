Analcoin 125% POS Fork Development By PressTab

The original Analcoin compile was delivered with a broken POS as discussed on Bitcointalk, due to an almost 
permanent absense of the original developer the community decided to fund the repair of Analcoin.

This repository is the updated Analcoin Fork which features 125% POS.
